# Basic Data Structure

## Stack

First-In-Last-Out(**FILO**) or Last-in-First-Out(**LIFO**). Stack can provides every last item that get pushed into the stack.

### Implementation

[Stack with Java (Implemented with LinkedList)](./CodeImplementations/LinkedListStack.java)

[ResizingArrayStack with Java (Implemented with Resizing Array)](./CodeImplementations/ResizingArrayStack.java)

## Queue

First-In-First-Out(**FIFO**) or Last-in-Last-Out(**LILO**). Queue can provides every first item that get enqueued into the queue.

### Implementation

[Queue with Java (Implemented with LinkedList)](./CodeImplementations/LinkedListQueue.java)
