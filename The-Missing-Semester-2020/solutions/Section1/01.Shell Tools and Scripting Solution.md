# Shell Tools and Scripting

1. Read [`man ls`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner

   - Includes all files, including hidden files
   - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
   - Files are ordered by recency
   - Output is colorized

   A sample output would look like this

   ```bash
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
    drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
    drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
    
   ```

   **Solution**: 

   ```bash
   ls -l # list all files in detail
   ls -a # list all files include hidden files
   ls -h # list in human readable format
   ls -t # Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting
   ls -r # reverse the order
   ls -G # set color
   
   ls -alhtG # correct answer
   ```

2. Write bash functions `marco` and `polo` that do the following. Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.

   **Solution**:

   Find the [macro.sh](./marco.sh) and [polo.sh](./polo.sh) for more detail.

3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

   ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
   
    n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))
   
    if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
       echo "Something went wrong"
       >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
       exit 1
    fi
   
    echo "Everything went according to plan"
   ```

   **Solution**:

   Find the [test_fail_script.sh](./test_fail_script.sh) for more detail.



4. As we covered in the lecture `find`’s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with **all** the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like `tar` take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the [`xargs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html) command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.

   Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`).

   If you’re on macOS, note that the default BSD `find` is different from the one included in [GNU coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands). You can use `-print0` on `find` and the `-0` flag on `xargs`. As a macOS user, you should be aware that command-line utilities shipped with macOS may differ from the GNU counterparts; you can install the GNU versions if you like by [using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils).

   **Solution**:

   ```bash
   # run following command to create dummy files
   mkdir dummyFolder && cd dummyFolder
   touch NoSpaceFile-{a..c}.html image_{1..3}.jpg filename\ with\ spaces\ {h..j}.html
   
   # allow name with spaces, will output anwer as arguments
   find . -name '*.html' -print0 | xargs -0
   
   # tar command
   -c create zip
   -f rename
   
   # zip all .jgp files in current dirctory with name ans.tar
   tar -cf ans.tar *.jpg
   
   # final answer
   find . -name '*.html' -print0 | xargs -0 tar -cf ans.tar
   
   ```

   

5. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?

   ```bash
   # find files in current dictory and print out as argument
   find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0
   
   # display time
   stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N"
   
   #sort
   sort -r #reverse order
   sort -n #numeric sort
   
   #head 
   head -1 take first line
   
   #cut
   # the default delimiter is tab
   cut -f # The list specifies fields, separated in the input by the field delimiter character
   
   # change the delimiter by using -d
   cut -f1 -d " " # get first item of list with delimiter " "
   cut -f2- -d " " # get all items from list except the first item with demiliter " "
   # the most recent modified file
   find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -f2
   
   # all files by recency
   find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat -f "%m%t%Sm %N" | sort -rn | cut -f2
   
   ```
